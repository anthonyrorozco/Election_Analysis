## Election-Audit Summary

This script may be used to obtain total votes by county, resulting in votes per county and the percentage of votes cast in each precinct.It returns the county with the most votes in a visually appealing way.Provide a breakdown of the number of votes cast and the percentage of total votes cast for each candidate.Finally, it returns the winning candidate's vote total and total votes received.

- Refactoring 
With a few changes, we can add more lists/dictionaries to function on a larger number of vote casts. Refactor the Python script so that it may take generic csv files with no hardcoded names. Show a map of Colorado with demographic data placed over it.
